                <h2>Hogwarts Castle</h2>
                <p>Hogwarts Castle is a large, seven-storey high building supported by magic, with a hundred and
                    forty-two staircases throughout its many towers and turrets and very deep dungeons. The castle
                    was built in the late Early Middle Ages (c. 993) by a wizard architect and the four most celebrated
                    wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.

                <h2>Hogwarts Houses</h2>
                <p>The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Houses at Hogwarts are
                    both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same
                    House share the same dormitory and many classes. The houses compete throughout the school year, by
                    earning and losing points for behaviour. The House with the most points wins the House Cup.

                <h2>Quidditch</h2>
                <p>Quidditch is a wizarding sport played on broomsticks and is the most popular game among wizards
                    and witches. The object of the game is to score more points than your opponents. Each goal is worth
                    ten points and catching the Golden Snitch is worth one-hundred and fifty points. The game ends when
                    the Snitch is caught or an agreement is reached between the captains of both teams.

                <h2>Hogsmeade</h2>
                <p>Hogsmeade Village is the only all-wizarding village in Britain. It was founded by Hengist of
                    Woodcroft. Since before 1714, Hogwarts third-years and above had been permitted weekend trips into
                    the village. Hogsmeade is a picturesque little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles
                    hanging in the trees during the holidays. It is also near the location of the train station used by
                    the Hogwarts Express.
